# Objective:
# Apply comparison and logical operators to a real-world problem.

# Scenario:
# Write a program that:

# Asks the user for today’s temperature.
temp = float(input("What's today's temperature? "))
# Prints whether it’s cold, warm, or hot using comparison operators.
if temp < -10 or temp > 110:
   elif temp < 50:
    print("It's cold.")
elif temp < 85:
    print("It's warm.")
else:
    print("It's hot.")
# If the temperature is out of range (below -10 or above 110), display “Extreme temperature warning!”
 print("Extreme temperature warning!")
